# Correlation heatmap

This is a script to create a correlation heatmap to show the Pearson correlation coefficients of self-reported smoking variables. It shows the correlation matrices for parental reported tobacco smoke exposure variables, DNA methylation at the AHRR CpG cg05575921 and the polyepigenetic smoking score in the EPIC array (N=284) datasets. P-values and correlation coefficients were calculated using the Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient test. Statistically significant correlations were marked with asterisks. AHRR CpG cg05575921 beta value was multiplied by -10.
